Donald Trump’s assassination attempt
Discussion
If his assassination attempt were to be successful, how impactful it would’ve been on the remaining course of the 20s? Would it have been impactful the same way JFK’s assassination was on the 60s?

Honestly it wasn’t very bad aim. In fact, the shot was quite impressive considering the best you can hope for with an AR with iron sights is a 3-5 inch spread at 150 yards. Aimed for the brain stem and got the ear.

Just for reference, even cheap ARs nowadays give a 1moa guarantee which is 1 inch at 100y. He was at roughly 164y. Optimum shooting leaves a 1.64 inch spread. Wind is not likely to be a factor at those short distances

If you're using irons, the limiting factor of your accuracy is your skill and eyesight, not the technical specifications of the rifle.

Lmao, do you think all Americans have this level of knowledge about guns? I’m American and I have no idea what they’re talking about. Using irons? Wtf is that? I thought irons are for golf or weightlifting. It’s almost like people’s very specific knowledgeable about random topics is unrelated to their nationality.

Terrible aim? He would have hit him harder if Trump did not move his head slightly. It was a shot on target, and he was likely preparing it beforehand. Seems calculated and planned out.

JFK can’t be compared. He was the sitting president not a candidate. Which led to a different president and a wildly different course of events. There’s no way of knowing how much this will impact history.

It would be worse than JFK. Trump was already president and is most likely going to win again. He has been the center of US politics since 2015.

Also when JFK was killed, the USA was not as divided as it was later in the 60s. The USA is incredibly volatile right now. It would have been catastrophic. Imaging the conspiracies that have been tossed around right now.

I disagree. He’s not the president he’s a candidate. I know the USA feels very divided right now, but it wouldn’t lead to all out civil war.

However, lbj assuming office led to the Vietnam war, and the subsequent social unrest that puts today’s division to shame.

Also, if Trump wins, Ukraine loses. And I can’t stress enough how regionally volatile that makes things, and how undoing NATOS influence puts us that much closer to global conflict.

It absolutely would have been the new JFK assassination; spawning conspiracy theories, widespread grief and anger, and civil unrest. Could have eventually become much worse than the JFK fallout.

I can see the response being different than JFK's assassination - as it was considered a period of widespread mourning and the end of an era of what many considered a time of prosperity.

The US is much more divided now than it was in 1963. While it would be a massive defining event, it would not have that same culture of national unity. I do agree that conspiracy theories would run wild, and there would be lots of anger and civil unrest - much worse than what happened following JFK's assassination.

is it really more divided now than the 1960s?

Vietnam War (first large-scale US war with large anti-war counter-culture)

Civil Rights Movement- groups fighting for Civil Rights (with disparities within them ie MLK vs Malcolm X/Nation of Islam) and those violently trying to keep segregation.

Feminist Movement really starts taking off, sets stage for Roe V Wade in 1973

Race Riots- 1967 alone saw 150 riots across America. With large notable ones also seen in 1964, 1965, 1966, 1969

My theory as a person not alive in the 60s: maybe more chaotic in the 60s, but the dividing lines are more clearly drawn today. Most people are either supportive of Rs or Ds (at least in a general sense), and believe the other side is not just ignorant but malignant. Now we're in one of the political gangs, and you're either in or out.

There was even an absurd fake news Who became famous in those hours after the Attack on Twitter.

An Italian troll Twitter account called "Moussolinho" took the photo of a well-known Italian football YouTuber, putting his photo of him and saying that he was Mark Violets, the sniper who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump a few hours ago.

The tweet was trolling for the Italian community. But it was taken up as serious information by thousands of Americans on Twitter.

So there were thousands of Americans convinced for some hours and that the person who shot Donald Trump has the face of this Italian YouTuber and is called Mark Violets.

His election was at a time when many countries were facing a new rise of populism and conservatism, and yes, the 2020 election had the most significant turnout at 66% in 120 years. According to Pew, at 49% and 46%, the 2018 and 2022 midterms had the highest turnout for any midterm since 1914 and 1970, respectively.

So you’re saying a new kind of security theater, but this time at rallies rather than airports?

It always has to take some big event to implement such measures. It would be better if companies and organizations were more proactive rather than reactive AND if the measures were actually reasonable within constitutional means and NOT invasive as they are today.

Would have been one of the most impactful moments in American history. I don’t think it’d spark civil war like some commenters are saying, but far right terrorism would definitely spike during the election cycle. But frankly, I’m not sure what’s worse—a Trump, who’s “the right is under attack” just got a billion times for potent and “justified”, who wishes to seek revenge on political opponents in an office where he has now been granted almost full immunity, or a different right wing psycho that doesn’t carry the same cult of personality that Trump has built for eight years.

Agreed. Leaderless, GOP would definitely be in immense turmoil and subsequently scramble to find another presidential candidate - possibly someone more frightening than Trump. Either way, both options are worse than each other.

Whatever you think of the man, it would definitely only make him a martyr for his cause. Definitely agree with other people here, there would be alot of civil unrest and anger. Honestly, him surviving that attempt might honestly be enough to get him reelected. If he really plays on that event, He'll be able to show undecided voters that he's the man for the job even though he's a convicted felon.

No they meant to say what they said, domestic terrorism isn’t the same thing as an insurgency, which would be a civil war. Domestic terrorism = string of attacks but not a sustained conflict, which can definitely break out between cells and militias of American citizens and the police forces and I honestly think Americans that genuinely believe their military, police, and government are invincible are deeply deeply naive and ignorant of history.

Probably Vance, Rubio, or Burgum. All 3 are contenders for the VP nomination, so it would make sense one of those three. Could see Cruz, Pompeo, or Christie also trying.

But an open convention would have been likely, which could bring some chaos. At that point a dark horse candidate could emerge. Surprisingly dark horse candidates have proven to be successful.

I could be wrong, but I think the current situation (attempt with minor injury) is going to be more impactful than if he had just been killed. Maybe if he survived but with a severe enough injury that he had to drop out that would be even worse than current state.

It would have impact far more like the assassinations of MLK and RFK in 1968, each representing very vocal populations up against the status-quo, the civil rights and anti-war movements. The chaos that ensued on the left - the King riots, the Democratic convention - basically gave the country to Nixon. The country was only beginning to feel the effects of those divisions in 1963, and was fairly united about the Cold War, and Johnson was if anything progressive by JFK standards.

Definitely not. 9/11 caused global upheaval. This is just causing national upheaval at the moment.

It's possible his assassination would spark violent protests from his supporters and domestic terrorism from far right groups. The Republican party would devolve into factional infighting between more traditional neo liberals and the populist MAGA wing for the presidential nomination. Depending on how bad things get politically, it may have actually paved the way for an easier Biden win. Conservatives would spread conspiracy theories that Biden stole the election and had Trump assassinated. Far right groups might then get more violent. Hard to tell. After Jan 6 they all quieted down due to their failed insurrection. I don't know if they would have the organization to try again without their dear leader. Trump would be deified by the right, and the left would breathe a heavy sigh of relief. Anyone saying civil war doesn't know what they are talking about. Violence yes, but civil war? No.

A24's Civil War would have become a reality. Not immediately, but it could become a catalyst.

That movie will never be reality. It’s a popcorn action film, not realistic at all.

Even if there was a “civil war”, it wouldn’t look like that movie. It’d be something more like a lower-level guerilla conflict in all likelihood.

People would believe that he wasn’t dead. His body double was the one who was shot on national television. Trump would return when the deep state would no longer be looking for him.

Literally everyone with internet access would’ve been able to see Trump’s head explode in 4K. IMO it would’ve been the most consequential assassination in US history.

Politics would have been less of a game to politicians if they felt like their actions had consequences.

Instead, we're here.

Well I would all but guarantee that some wack job right winger would try and assassinate Biden. You take a group of people fanatical about guns and usually rather experienced in shooting, and tell them someone they revere almost as a hero or even god got assassinated by someone of the opposing party, how does that look?

As a matter of fact, a 20-year old right wing nut by the name of Sai Varshith Kandula, a Missiouri resident of Indian origin, did indeed devise a sinister, grandiose plan to slam a truck into the White House perimeter to gain access to the building, kill Biden, overthrow the government, and put himself in power of a dictatorship in May ‘23 according to the US DOJ website.

Ironically, the guy wasn’t even a citizen. He was an alien, so that makes it even more bizarre for me. Additionally, the scary thing is both candidates can still be assassinated, even after the election season concludes for good. That said, It was only a matter of time before someone attempted to assassinate Trump.

You know you’re on Reddit when all the answers are “far-right terrorism” would be the result… uhhh we just witnessed the most consequential far-left terrorist event since the BLM riots burned down the every major city in America. Can we take a moment to recognize that? 

I believe the black vote (whether killed or not) is the biggest outcome of this. Trump (or his replacement if killed) is going to get a substantial increase from black America supporters

The shooter was a registered Republican who happened to donate $15 to “Progressive Turnout Project PAC” - a democratic organization, which is puzzling.

If he is indeed a Republican, why would he even think let alone attempt to assassinate Trump, never mind donate to the Democrats?

All I know is that the moment Trump got hit by one of the bullets and stood up, fist in air with the American flag above, he undeniably won, and won the election. The moment the left brought violence to settle differences of opinion, they lost, and lost massive they did.

The police “didn’t understand” what every single bystander was telling them when they were screaming “THERES A GUY ON THE ROOF WITH A GUN”

I’m surprised nobody in the crowd or trump himself didn’t hear that.

This whole thing makes zero sense. How, in a million years, could the secret service not have swept that building? It’s the most obvious vantage point for a sniper and it was less than 200 yards from the stage. Not to mention the fact that this kid never posted anything radical online, and just happened to be a registered Republican?

If you don’t think there’s something fishy about this whole thing then you need to question your sanity.

My thought is that some maga senator would rise up and take the trump mantle. The danger in this is he would have a brain and be able to implement his plans instead being an idiot like Trump.
